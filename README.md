### Hi there 👋 I'm Genevieve

I'm a mathematics student. The below text was originally created by [@spacekookie](https://spacekookie.de/) - a big thank you to them!

**I don't want to use GitHub!**  The internet should be a decentralised network,
and companies have far too much power over our lives.
Github is no exception to this, and while I do have this account to participate
in other projects, I don't maintain any code here for that reason.

Unfortunately GitHub is a social necessity for involvement in software projects,
reminiscent of the role of Facebook in the early 2010's for social engagements.

Instead of GitHub, why not distribute your work across different forges?
Evaluating new forges from time to time could let you potentially discover
a nice community of developers, or a better workflow.
I think we should all strive to get off code-facebook.
I know this is hard, and the companies we work for make it even harder.
But that's not a reason not to try.

In that spirit, you can find me on the following forges:
